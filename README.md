# Fitness Assistant
The goal with this project is to create a desktop application to help track calories and weight for health improvement. I noticed other applications require the user to pay for a subscription and I want to offer a free-to-use alternative.

## Todo
1. Create the main menu and add basic functionality.
2. Add a tab to the window that opens a local-hosted website that shows the user their current heartbeat using JavaScript via bluetooth. The webiste background color is changed or BPM location on the screen is changed depending on how high it is.
